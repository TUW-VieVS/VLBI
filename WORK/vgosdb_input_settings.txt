% This file can be used to specify the institute provider of the data files in the vgos database which should be used for processing.
%
% ### Possible settings ###
%
% => institute:
%      - List of institution flags, separtated by white space.
%      - All provided institutions will be considerd when selecting a wrapper file.
%      - The 1st entry (left) has the highest priority, the 2nd the 2nd-highest priority, and so on...
%      - The entry "noInst" declares that wrapper without any institution flag should be considered
%        - The priority ranking is alao taken into account for the "noInst" tag, i.e. if it is the first in the list, wrappers with no institution flag will be selected first.
%
% => frequency_band:
%      - VieVS supports 4 possibilites for the frequencyband parameters:
%          - GroupDelayFull_bX (final X-band group delay with ambiguity correction, corresponds to the delay in the NGS file)
%          - GroupDelayFull_bS (final S-band group delay with ambiguity correction)
%          - GroupDelay_bX (X-band group delay without ambiguity correction)
%          - GroupDelay_bS (S-band group delay without ambiguity correction)

% => wrapper_k:
%     - Define the k-flag (usually "all" or "ngs")
%
% => wrapper_version:
%     - Declare the version flag (minimum version 4 is required!)
%     - If this information is not provided, the highest version will be taken automatically (min. version 4).
%
% => ionosphere_correction (default = on):
%     - on (ionosphere correction will be applied to observation)
%     - off (ionosphere correction will NOT be applied to observation)
%
% => ambiguity correction (default = on):
%     - on (ambiguities are resolved in observables)
%     - off (ambiguities are not resolved in observables)
